More specifically we will be:

- Setting up our Daml App, in this case a project called create-daml-app
- Building and running a local Fabric ledger with Daml support through the daml-on-fabric project
- Deploying our create-daml-app code to our Fabric ledger where it will record its state
- Running a JSON endpoint that automatically creates every endpoint we need for our Daml application
- Starting up a React UI that will consume these JSON endpoints with no lower level interaction with Daml or Fabric necessary
